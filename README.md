## üöÄ Our Mission

AmplifyXA is the AI-powered attribution platform for visionary CMOs. Our mission is to transform marketing from a cost center into a proven revenue engine by connecting every marketing euro to its financial outcome.

We build technology to bring financial clarity to marketing, enabling leaders to pilot their growth with data-backed confidence.

## üí° Our Philosophy

We build on three core principles:

1.  **Attribution First:** Before you can optimize, you must measure accurately. We believe a reliable, unified view of revenue attribution is the non-negotiable foundation for any intelligent marketing strategy.

2.  **Clarity Over Complexity:** The MarTech landscape is noisy. Our job is to find the signal. We translate data chaos into clear, actionable business insights, not just another complex dashboard.

3.  **Partnership Over Product:** We build *with* our customers, not just *for* them. Our "Founding-Customer Program" is at the heart of our development, ensuring every feature solves a real-world CMO challenge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Featured Open Source Project

As part of our commitment to robust and transparent engineering, we contribute to the open-source ecosystem.

### [@amplifyxa/uid2](https://github.com/bilLkarkariy/amplifyxa-uid2)

A lightweight, high-performance TypeScript library for privacy-safe UID2 email hashing, built to IAB specs.

**Why it matters:** This library is a core component of our commitment to building a secure and privacy-centric attribution engine. Accurate attribution requires precise identity resolution, and doing so while respecting user privacy is fundamental to our approach.
