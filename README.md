# Hi, I'm Billel Helali ðŸ‘‹

### Founder & CEO at [AmplifyXA](https://www.amplifyxa.com)

I'm an engineer obsessed with building technology that solves real-world business problems.

---

### ðŸ’¡ About Me

After a decade in the French Tech ecosystem, I noticed a recurring pattern: marketing leaders, armed with dozens of tools, still struggle to answer one simple question from their board: "What was the ROI of our marketing spend?"

I realized this wasn't a marketing problem, but a systems engineering problem. I founded AmplifyXA to solve it.

Our mission is to bring financial clarity to marketing by building the first **"Attribution-First"** intelligence platform.

### ðŸš€ What I'm working on at AmplifyXA

- Building our core data ingestion pipeline to connect with CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce.
- Developing our proprietary attribution models using Python and machine learning.
- Architecting a scalable infrastructure on AWS to serve our founding customers.

### ðŸŒ± My Core Principles
- **Clarity over Complexity:** If a feature doesn't make things simpler, we don't build it.
- **Data-Backed Decisions:** Every line of code should ultimately serve a business outcome.
- **Authentic Partnership:** Co-building our platform with our first customers.

### ðŸ“« Let's Connect

- I'm always open to talking with CMOs and marketing leaders about their attribution challenges. Find me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-profile-url/).
